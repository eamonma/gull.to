// Versioned genus adjustment data extracted from taxonomy authority drift analyses.
// This file is intentionally data-only (no logic) to support easier diff review.
// Fields:
//  - from: original scientific name as found in one source
//  - to: canonical scientific name to reconcile on
//  - reason: short justification for the adjustment
//  - ebird_version: eBird taxonomy version/year where this form was observed
//  - ibp_version: IBP/AOS list version identifier (e.g., LIST24 / 2024)
